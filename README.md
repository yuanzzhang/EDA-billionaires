# Study of Billionaires

This project analyzed the Forbes World's Billionaires lists from 1996-2014, using 22 variables and 2614 observations from the [CORGIS Dataset Project](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/billionaires/).

The goal was to identify factors influencing the rank of billionaires based on their income. The focus was on age, gender, company type, location, inherited wealth, and the year the company was founded. The analysis included a simple linear regression of the relationship between age and wealth, and a randomization test on the difference in mean wealth between male and female billionaires in 2014.

The results showed a positive linear relationship between wealth and age, and no significant difference in mean wealth between male and female billionaires in 2014. However, the proportion of female billionaires was much smaller than that of male billionaires.
